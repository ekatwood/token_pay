# token-pay

Open source solution to allow the user to make a product or service available, where the user can send any Solana token via Phantom Wallet, and the vendor or merchant receives USDC or SOL.

Implemented with Flutter, Firebase, JavaScript or Rust for smart contracts, Google Cloud functions for APIs and scheduled functions, and Rayidum protocol API for swaps.

Implements https://github.com/ekatwood/escrow_subscription to handle subscription model payments.
